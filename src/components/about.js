  <p> I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Computer Science from the University of West Georgia, with a focus on software engineering. When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy riding bikes, watching Star Trek, baking muffins, and looking at pictures of cats on the internet. I live in Woodstock, IL with my husband, Kyle, and our cat, Sprocket.</p>
